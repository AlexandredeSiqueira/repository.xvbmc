		<description lang="en">This is a mod of the Exodus addon. Changes are minimal: just 3 lines edited to regain compatibility with [COLOR ff0084ff]M[/COLOR]etalli[COLOR ff0084ff]Q[/COLOR].Please visit www.tvaddons.ag for Exodus support and assistance! Kindly note that Exodus is not an official part of the media player you are running, and therefore not to be mentioned within official support channels, this addon has nothing to do with the media player itself, nor it’s intended use, it is simply a third party plugin which has been added to your system.</description>
