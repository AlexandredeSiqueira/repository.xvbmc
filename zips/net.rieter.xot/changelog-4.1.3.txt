[B]Retrospect v4.1.3 - Changelog - 2017-02-03[/B]
This new release of Retrospect introduces some new features such as adding the option to cloak (hide) items from a listing and keep it hidden until it is uncloaked again. That way it is possible to tailor some standard listings a bit. The cloaking works on folder types. Besides this some code simplifications were introduced that make life a bit easier. Especially with the new login features for some channels the handling of (session) cookies had to be more consistent.

Finally, a lot of time and effort was put into making Kodi Krypton handle stream, proxies and http headers in a much better way than it was done previously. Initially proxy and custom http headers were completely removed from Kodi Krypton. However, together with the Kodi dev 'fritsch' we were able to restore most functionality in a proper way. This saved the custom channel proxies and some other features based on http headers.

And finally a large amount of channels were updated over the past 6 months. And some channels were added such as School TV and a lot of new Belgium channels. Here is a list of all the detailed changes:
