v0.9.78

    Hotfix for bad status error notification, #832
    Yet another fix for the regression of episodes not being
    marked as watched in library ?? #821 #832
    Fixed resuming episodes from watched progress in library
    since the introduction of the 'Resume playback from
    library integration' setting, #736


v0.9.77

    watched (regression), #821

    home screen widgets, Torrents menu or WebUI, #739 #300 #256
    Added support for multi-part RAR archives, #613
        Download will need to be completed before playback can
        start and will require around twice the amount of space
        to allow for extraction
        Requires the unrar (or unrar.exe on Windows) utility
        to be installed globally on your system (in your $PATH)
    Added automatic selection of current episode in season packs
    Added year parameter to episode and season payloads
    to providers
    Torrents no longer get paused when starting to simply
    resume playback
    Fixed unicode path usage in overlay status
    Updated WebUI header image


v0.9.75

    Added feature to move finished downloads to separate folders,
    #440, #536, #97
        Files will only be moved after seeding is finished (see
        BitTorrent settings), and will wait if currently playing
        If the same item exists with library integration, the strm
        file will be removed to prevent duplicates, leaving you
        with a local file in your library instead ??
        Note: Season packs still need work, since we move
        individual files and delete the folder afterwards, so
        you can easily lose a few episodes this way. This will
        be fixed in the next release, but I didn't want to delay
        this feature any longer. You've been warned until then.
    Properly check we have valid, writable, locally mounted paths
    and inform user otherwise, #768, #641, #440, #419...

        seeding progress bar
        Added total download/upload rate stats
        Improved responsive for tablet/mobile, #743

    stale .parts files when starting up, #735
    Notify when getting custom Trakt lists and username isn't
    set, and log errors or bad status, #751
    Fixed missing fanart for Trakt items causing an Internal
    server error
    Fixed library strm files using /play and /links URIs after
    library refactor, preventing the 'Choose stream automatically'
    setting from being used, #745
    Fixed handling of unicode characters in Windows paths, #732
    Fixed handling of unicode characters in notifications, #740

    Retry checking if Kodi's JSON-RPC is enabled, #712


v0.9.68

    Greatly improved initial installation process, #706
    'Background handling' is now 'Do not ask to keep downloading'
    Prevent daemon from starting and inform user if no

    Color-coded status in torrents list
    Fixed deleting multiple files from web UI

v0.9.66

    Fixed unintuitive controls in choose stream dialog and give focus to
    first list item
    Fixed new resolve/scrape progress indicator blocking timeouts
    Fixed trackers that failed not updating progress indicator
    Removed skipping torrent resolver for public torrent files that have
    their infohash set, since the torrent link might still be invalid
    Using the 'Clear cache' option now only clears directory listing
    caches to reduce the load on TheMovieDB. If you absolutely need
    to remove all cache files for some probably wrong reason,
    do it manually from your userdata folder
    Added 'Do Not Disturb' mode in Appearance section of settings, which
    disables sound on all notifications, #695

    just use its default if no connections limit is set, fixes
    remaining 'stuck on Finding...' issues, #683
    Possible fix for crashes related to failing JSON-RPC calls

    bar animation, and show version numbers at the bottom


v0.9.62

    Fixed Trakt rate limiting to reduce errors with code 429
        This will still need to be battle-tested, and other
        improvements are planned for this
    Fixed crashes when no JSON-RPC connection is available, #677
    Fixed crash when choosing Trakt as scraper for Kodi library
    content and content isn't actually scraped from Trakt, #673

    Re-implemented proper automatic re-scan of Kodi library after
    updates and added setting in Advanced section (defaults to
    Enabled to match behavior prior to 0.9.61), #431
    Caching got seriously overhauled and improved.
        Added cache warming on startup for near-instant
        loading of Trending / Most popular lists ??
        Proper expiration times were finely tuned to make sure
        pages load as fast as possible, while always having
        fresh content and no more episodes not being updated
        5 pages of results are pre-fetched and cached to prevent
        results from shifting between pages. You will
        notice longer wait times every 5 page unless the shows
        and movies they contain have already been cached.
        Please try not to use 'Clear cache' option, at all. And
        only if absolutely necessary otherwise. Clearing caches,
        contrary to popular belief, does not typically solve any
        issue in Quasar, on the contrary. It only causes added
        strain on everything by having to fetch the exact same
        information over and over again about movies and shows.
            If you do need to forcefully refresh something,
            head over to your userdata for Quasar and remove
            the specific file in question that starts with
            page.... Their names are now using easily
            recognizable patterns to allow selective clearing.
            Improved, automated options will soon be added also.
        Fixed TMDB lists not following the 'Results per page'
        setting, #468
    Cleanly notify when Quasar is still starting up
    Moved 'Torrents' above 'Add torrent', 'Trakt' above 'Search'
    in both Movies and TV Shows, and 'Genres' are now under their
    own directory in both sections
    Removing torrents from web UI no longer triggers
    'Ask to delete' in Kodi
    Label and alignment fixes in web UI, fixed header link
    Fixed 'Finished' torrents showing up as 'Paused'
    Renamed TV scraper setting to
    'TV show scraper used by Kodi library' for more clarity
    Golang was updated to 1.8rc3 and the stability and performance
    gains are significant. Of interest from their release notes:

        The overhead of calls from Go into C has been reduced by
        about half.
        The new back end reduces the CPU time required by our
        benchmark programs by 20-30% on 32-bit ARM systems. For
        64-bit x86 systems, which already used the SSA back end
        in Go 1.7, the gains are a more modest 0-10%. Other
        architectures will likely see improvements closer to
        the 32-bit ARM numbers.


v0.9.61

    Complete overhaul of library integration
        Duplicates are properly handled by default
            Make sure you set the 'TV scraper used by library'
            according to your Kodi library content, defaults to
            TVDB like Kodi. This is needed to match the unique IDs
            of shows and episodes to properly detect duplicates,
            and the setting has been moved right under
            'Library path' to show its importance.
            Removed confusing and now obsolete 'Ignore duplicates'
            setting, #632
        Syncing lists with Trakt no longer re-adds manually removed
        movies and shows. If you add them back later on, they will
        start getting synced again, #632
        Missing seasons and episodes can be added with the new
        'Merge to library' context menu on TV Shows, #632
            Synced shows from Trakt automatically get merged
        No more QuasarDB.json, it will automatically get imported
        into the brand new BoltDB library and removed if successful.
        The new library sits in your profile folder as library.db
        Removing from library can now be done from Quasar
        like before, from the library directly, or by simply removing
        the .strm files and using Kodi's 'Clean library' feature
        Quasar no longer triggers Kodi's library scan when it updates
        its internal library, and never should have done so this
        will be back as an option in the next release. It will
        instead ask you if you want to scan (or clean) your Kodi
        library when you add or remove an item managed by Quasar. For
        automatic re-scans and cleanups, use the fully-featured
        XBMC Library Auto Update add-on, or Kodi's own
        'Update library on startup' setting for one-time scans.
            Pro-tip: Set Quasar's library update delay on startup
            1 minute lower than your automatic re-scan
    Added 'Show unaired seasons' and 'Show unaired episodes'
    settings, #633
    Copied the Trakt/Trending lists for movies and shows above
    'Most Popular' and 'Recent Episodes' respectively
    Only 'Choose stream...' or 'Choose stream automatically' show up
    in context menu depending on default preference
    Fixed various 'GetShow' and 'GetImages' errors
    Descriptive error handling, obscure "Navigation error" is
    gone for good ??

    Color-coded labels and statistics in web UI
    Translations now support placeholders

        Android users might be able to use external storage with the much improved disk operations, and OS-mounted NAS might even work too, please report on this (#51, #72, #98, #131, #233, #481, #482, #608, ...)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scakemyer/plugin.video.quasar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scakemyer/plugin.video.quasar)

What it is
----------
Quasar is an torrent finding and streaming engine. It doesn't go on torrent websites for legal reasons. However, it calls specially crafted addons (called providers) that are installed separately. They are normal XBMC addons, and thus can be installed/updated/distributed just like any other addon.

This project is a fork of the well known, but no longer maintained Pulsar project from [steeve](https://github.com/steeve/plugin.video.pulsar).
Big thanks for his great job.

Supported platforms
-------------------
- Windows
- Linux 32/64 bits (starting Ubuntu 12.04)
- Linux ARM (Raspberry Pi, Cubox i4pro etc...)
- OS X 64 bits
- Android ARM and x64

Download
--------
See the [Releases](https://github.com/scakemyer/plugin.video.quasar/releases) page. **Do NOT use the `Download ZIP` button on this page.**


Installation
------------
- Install Quasar like any other addon
- Go to Settings > Services > Remote Control and **enable both options**
- Restart XBMC

Build
-----
The entire build process of Quasar is automated using Travis CI, and that's a
good thing because it's quite a complicated one with many dependencies and
repositories. Here's the stack from top to bottom:

- [quasar](https://github.com/scakemyer/quasar) - The Quasar daemon itself, built on top of the cross-compiled libtorrent-go
- [libtorrent-go](https://github.com/scakemyer/libtorrent-go) - The libtorrent library with Go bindings, built using cross-compiler
- [cross-compiler](https://github.com/scakemyer/cross-compiler) - Builds the base images to, you guessed it, cross-compile Quasar

#### Build status of each project
| quasar daemon | libtorrent-go | cross-compiler |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scakemyer/quasar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scakemyer/quasar) | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scakemyer/libtorrent-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scakemyer/libtorrent-go) | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scakemyer/cross-compiler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scakemyer/cross-compiler) |

There are different ways to build the Quasar daemon. You can either pull the different Docker images or build it all yourself. If you want to go for the latter, start by building the cross-compiler images, then libtorrent-go, and come back to Quasar afterwards. There should be enough info in each of the projects to get you started, but you'll obviously have to dive into the code at some point.

Since the whole build process is now automated, this repository is using [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/scakemyer/quasar-binaries) from the last Quasar daemon build as a submodule. Here's how you'd build this add-on using those:
```
git clone https://github.com/scakemyer/plugin.video.quasar
cd plugin.video.quasar
git submodule update --init
make
```

How it works
------------
Quasar is a torrent finding and streaming engine. **It doesn't go on torrent websites for legal reasons**. It calls specially crafted addons (called **providers**) that are installed separately. They are normal XBMC addons, and thus can be installed/updated/distributed just like any other add-on.

Quasar is centred around media: it browses media from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and [TheTVDB](http://thetvdb.com/).
And so, when you decide you want to watch a media (i.e. given an IMDB or TVDB Id), here's what Quasar does:

- Enumerate the installed providers
- Call each provider to find the media you want to watch (in parallel)
- Each provider returns a list of BT links they found
- Collects and de-duplicates all the links
- Goes on the BitTorrent network to find out the number of seeds and peers in real time (i.e. not provided by the provider)
- Finds out of which quality are the different links (thanks to their name)
- Ranks the links by quality and availability (Quasar privileges quality over availability, but it's not dumb. However, you can get a full list to choose from manually it you want, or enable 'Choose Stream by default' to always choose manually)
- Sends the chosen link to the BitTorrent streaming engine (brand new, and completely rewritten)

All of this is done in less than 1s. Quasar is around 95% Go, and thus, it's *fast*. Very fast, actually.

The BitTorrent streaming engine is brand new and very resilient (or at least it's designed to be). It's built on top of the brand new libtorrent 1.0 (which had special patches for the streaming case). So it's very optimized, especially for low CPU machines. I have yet to find a media that doesn't play with the engine.


Providers
---------
As said before, Quasar **relies on providers to find streams**. Providers are easy to write, and average ~20 lines of Python. As they are normal XBMC add-ons, which can have their own configuration (although it is not recommended because it complicates things).

Sample Quasar provider: [https://github.com/scakemyer/script.quasar.dummy](https://github.com/scakemyer/script.quasar.dummy)

Providers are given a max amount of time to run before Quasar considers them to be too slow. The timeouts are as follow:
- 10 seconds on Intel CPUs
- 20 seconds on multi-core ARM CPUs
- 30 seconds on single core ARM CPUs (Raspberry Pi)

Please note that for legal reasons, **I won't discuss, develop nor distribute any providers connecting to illegal sources**. So there is no need to ask me.
While I can partake in general discussions regarding provider development, **I won't do so for illegal sources specific problems**.


FAQ
---
##### I can't code. How can I help?
Spread the word. Talk about it with your friends, show them, make videos, tutorials. Talk about it on social networks, blogs etc...

##### The plugin doesn't work, what can I do?
Please search currently [open and closed issues](https://github.com/scakemyer/plugin.video.quasar/issues) to see if it has already been reported and/or fixed. If not then add a new issue with a short but descriptive title, a detailed description and of course a link to the logs. If you don't know how to do that, just follow the guide at: [http://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy](http://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy). If you actually went through the logs and know the relevant part, you can instead paste that, as long as it's shorter than a hundred lines or so, and please enclose it in triple back-quotes for readability.

##### Can I seek in a video?
Yes, but it can fail.

##### What about seeding?
When watching a torrent, **you will be seeding while you watch the stream**.

##### Does it downloads the whole file? Do I need the space? Is it ever deleted?
Yes, yes and yes.

##### Can I keep the file after watching it?
Yes, change it in the addon settings.

##### Can I set it to download directly to my NAS?
Yes, but **you need to mount your NAS via the OS, not via XBMC**.

##### Provider X is blocked in my country/ISP, how can I set another domain?
Sorry, I won't comment of specific providers.
